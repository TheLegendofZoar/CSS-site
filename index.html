          <h2>Hello.</h2>

            <img id="wordpress" class="" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/27/27928.png" alt="WordPress">
            <h3>WordPress</h3>
            <p>My first skill is being able to make good-looking and responsive websites using the WordPress Framework.</p>
            <p>Since I am self-taught, this was the first platfrom I learned to use to build websites. I started at the age of 14 by creating a blog I used to call "My Paper Blade" which was where I posted Poetry. </p>
            <p>Though it took a few years, I eventually finished highschool and slowy developed my love for webdesign after making a few website changes for my employer at the time,<br> and have been working on this part of my skillset ever since.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row">
            <img id="HTML" class="" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/5968/5968267.png" alt="HTML">
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>I have been using and working with HTML since highschool which is when I took basic computer literacy.</p>
            <p>Though the name would imply that you may not learn too much if you are already used to computers, there was quite a bit of information I did not know, <br> and it was in this class that I built my first HTML site. <br> (Provided, it didn't exactly look great.)</p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row">
            <img id="CSS" class="" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/919/919826.png" alt="CSS">
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS is another of the skills I have, and though it may not be the best yet, I am currently taking a Udemy course that is helping me get the hang of it.</p>
            <p>By the end of my course I should have a widely expanded understanding of what it takes to design a website and how to make it look good as well as being functional.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row">
            <img id="mySQL" class="" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/288/288882.png" alt="mySQL">
            <h3>mySQL</h3>
            <p>Though it isn't something I've been taught, I have managed to get the hang of the basics of mySQL and creating differnet website databases as well as how to edit and use them.</p>
            <p>I owe a lot of my knowledge of this topic to my mentor Lourens Tredoux, who is also my uncle and godfather, since he has had to show me countless times what to do when I was struggling.</p>
